# Task 8 (CTR racing mode, R2): RaceSession must work UNCHANGED against the
# new Sanity Shores circuit -- these are the same three proof shapes
# tests/racing/test_race_session.gd already runs against the graybox loop
# (boot wiring, full-race completion via teleport-to-gate, out-of-order
# rejection), just pointed at scenes/racing/race_sanity_shores.tscn and its
# 12 gates / 3 laps instead of 6 gates. If RaceSession needed a single line
# of scene-specific logic to drive this real scene, that would BE the
# "session changes -> stop and report BLOCKED" signal from the task brief;
# it does not, so this file exists purely to prove that on the real scene,
# not to re-test RaceSession's own mechanics (already covered once).
#
# Gate crossings are driven by teleporting the kart's global_position onto
# the real authored CheckpointGate Area3D and letting Godot's own physics
# detect the overlap, exactly like test_race_session.gd's own _cross_gate.
